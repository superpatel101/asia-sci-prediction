## üìä Model 1: ASIA Motor Score Predictor (Regression)

### Purpose
Predicts the **ASIA motor score at discharge** (0-100 scale) using all available features.

### Performance
- **R¬≤ Score:** 0.9053 (explains 90.5% of variance)
- **RMSE:** 8.30 points
- **MAE:** 5.42 points

### Key Features (Top 5)
1. **AASATotA** (26.7%) - ASIA total at admission
2. **AASAImDs** (17.3%) - ASIA impairment at discharge ‚ö†Ô∏è
3. **ABdMMDis** (12.3%) - Bowel/bladder at discharge ‚ö†Ô∏è
4. **AASAImAd** (9.8%) - ASIA impairment at admission
5. **AFScorDs** (8.0%) - Functional score at discharge ‚ö†Ô∏è

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note: Data Leakage
This model uses **discharge features** to predict discharge outcome. While highly accurate (90.5%), it has **limited predictive value** because discharge information isn't available at admission.

**Use cases:**
- ‚úÖ Understanding relationships between discharge measures
- ‚úÖ Quality control and data validation
- ‚úÖ Retrospective analysis
- ‚ùå Early prediction at admission (contains future data)

# Predict impairment grades
grades = predict(data_df=df)
probabilities = predict(data_df=df, return_proba=True)

# Convert to letter grades
for i, (grade, proba) in enumerate(zip(grades, probabilities)):

## üéì Key Insights from Both Models

### 1. Admission Impairment is Most Predictive
- Model 2 shows **38.3% importance** for admission impairment
- Initial injury severity strongly predicts discharge status
- Clinical implication: Early assessment is critical

### 2. Time Matters
- Days from injury to rehab (14.2% importance in Model 2)
- Earlier rehabilitation may improve outcomes
- Clinical implication: Expedite admission processes

### 3. Motor Scores Are Highly Recoverable
- Model 1 shows strong correlation between admission & discharge
- But significant recovery is possible
- Clinical implication: Rehabilitation has measurable impact

### 4. Grade E (Normal) is Highly Predictable
- 98% recall, 90% precision
- Patients who recover fully show clear patterns
- Clinical implication: Can identify good prognosis early

### 5. Grade D is Challenging
- Only 105 samples (0.7% of data)
- Lower prediction accuracy
- Clinical implication: Need more data for this category

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Limitations

### Model 1 (Motor Score)
- ‚ùå Uses discharge data ‚Üí Not truly predictive
- ‚ùå Cannot be used at admission
- ‚úÖ Excellent for retrospective analysis
- ‚úÖ Useful for understanding relationships

### Model 2 (Impairment Grade)
- ‚úÖ Truly predictive (admission data only)
- ‚úÖ Clinically useful at admission
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 82.6% accuracy means 17.4% error rate
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Grade D predictions are less reliable

### Both Models
- Dataset-specific: May need retraining for different populations
- No confidence intervals: Single point estimates
- Static predictions: Don't model recovery trajectory
- Missing data: Some features have missing values

## üî¨ Future Improvements

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Create Admission-Only Motor Score Model**
   - Remove discharge features from Model 1
   - Train truly predictive motor score model
   - Compare performance to current Model 1

   - Use advanced sampling techniques (SMOTE)
   - Try cost-sensitive learning

3. **Add Confidence Intervals**
   - Implement quantile regression
   - Bootstrap prediction intervals
   - Communicate uncertainty better

4. **Temporal Modeling**
   - Track recovery over time
   - Predict trajectories, not just endpoints
   - Identify early vs late recoverers

5. **External Validation**
   - Test on different hospital systems
   - Validate across demographics
   - Assess generalizability

6. **Model Deployment**

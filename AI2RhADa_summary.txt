QUESTION 1: What is the TREND in AI2RhADa that correlates with each grade?
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ACTUAL DATA (Mean Days by Grade):

  Grade A (Complete):              60.0 days
  Grade B (Sensory incomplete):    53.2 days  ⬇️  Decreasing
  Grade C (Motor incomplete <50%): 45.9 days  ⬇️  Decreasing
  Grade D (Motor incomplete ≥50%): 566.5 days ⚠️  ANOMALY!
  Grade E (Normal):                63.8 days  ⬆️  Increasing

⚠️ CRITICAL: Grade D is misleading! 62.9% have code "888" (Not Applicable)

ACTUAL TREND (Excluding code 888):

  Grade A: 42.1 days  ⬆️
  Grade B: 37.9 days  ⬇️ Slight decrease
  Grade C: 32.0 days  ⬇️ Decreasing
  Grade D: 22.3 days  ⬇️ SHORTEST!
  Grade E: 39.9 days  ⬆️ Increases again

🎯 KEY FINDING: NO SIMPLE LINEAR TREND!
  • More severe injuries (A, B) → ~40-42 days
  • Moderate severity (C) → ~32 days (faster to rehab)
  • Mild incomplete (D) → ~22 days (FASTEST to rehab!)
  • Normal function (E) → ~40 days

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

QUESTION 2: What does "7.5% feature importance" mean?
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ACTUAL IMPORTANCE: 14.2% (2nd most important feature!)

SIMPLE EXPLANATION:
  "Out of 100% total 'usefulness' spread across all 26 features,
   AI2RhADa accounts for 14.2% of the model's predictive power."

WHAT IT MEANS:
  • The Random Forest made ~200 trees × many splits = thousands of decisions
  • When AI2RhADa was used to split data, it improved predictions by X amount
  • Sum all these improvements → AI2RhADa contributed 14.2% of total
  • This makes it the #2 most important feature (after admission impairment)

ANALOGY:
  If the model is a company predicting outcomes:
  • Total predictive "budget" = 100%
  • Admission impairment gets 38% (CEO)
  • AI2RhADa gets 14% (VP) ← YOU ARE HERE
  • All other 24 features share remaining 48%

WHAT IT TELLS YOU:
  ✓ AI2RhADa is VERY important (top 2!)
  ✓ The model relies heavily on this feature
  ✓ Knowing time-to-rehab helps predict outcomes

WHAT IT DOESN'T TELL YOU:
  ✗ Which specific grades are affected more
  ✗ Whether longer or shorter times are better/worse
  ✗ How it interacts with other features

QUESTION 3: How does this differ from SHAP impact?
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FEATURE IMPORTANCE (14.2%):           SHAP VALUES:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📊 ONE NUMBER                         📊 THOUSANDS OF NUMBERS
   "14.2%"                               One per patient per class

🌍 GLOBAL                             👤 INDIVIDUAL
   Average across all patients          Specific to each patient
   and all classes                      and each class

❓ WHAT                                ❓ HOW & WHY
   "How important overall?"             "How did it affect THIS patient?"

🎯 CLASS-AGNOSTIC                     🎯 CLASS-SPECIFIC
   Same number for all grades           Different for each grade:
                                        - Grade A impact
                                        - Grade B impact  
                                        - Grade C impact
                                        - etc.

↔️ NO DIRECTION                        ↔️ DIRECTIONAL
   Doesn't tell if positive             Positive = increases probability
   or negative                          Negative = decreases probability

🔢 MAGNITUDE ONLY                     🔢 MAGNITUDE + DIRECTION
   "This much important"                "Pushes prediction this way"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

CONCRETE EXAMPLE:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Consider Patient John with AI2RhADa = 50 days, AASAImAd = C

FEATURE IMPORTANCE says:
  "AI2RhADa is 14.2% important for the model overall."
  
SHAP VALUES would say:
  "For THIS patient (John):
   • Grade A probability: -0.03 (decreases by 3%)
   • Grade B probability: -0.02 (decreases by 2%)
   • Grade C probability: +0.08 (INCREASES by 8%) ← most likely
   • Grade D probability: -0.01 (decreases by 1%)
   • Grade E probability: -0.02 (decreases by 2%)
   
   John's 50-day AI2RhADa pushes him TOWARD Grade C and AWAY from others."

ANALOGY:
  Feature Importance = "How good is this basketball player overall?"
  SHAP = "How many points did this player score in each specific game?"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

YOUR SPECIFIC MENTION: "Significant impact for Grades 2, 3, 4"
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

This means:
  • SHAP analysis showed AI2RhADa has larger AVERAGE |SHAP| values for
    Grades B (2), C (3), and D (4) compared to Grades A (1) and E (5)
  
  • In other words: The model "cares more" about AI2RhADa when predicting
    these middle grades
  
  • This is DIFFERENT from the 14.2% which is averaged across everything

Example interpretation:
  • Grade A prediction: AI2RhADa matters "some" (low SHAP magnitude)
  • Grade B prediction: AI2RhADa matters "a lot" (high SHAP magnitude) ←
  • Grade C prediction: AI2RhADa matters "a lot" (high SHAP magnitude) ←
  • Grade D prediction: AI2RhADa matters "a lot" (high SHAP magnitude) ←
  • Grade E prediction: AI2RhADa matters "some" (low SHAP magnitude)

The 14.2% is the AVERAGE importance across all of the above.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

BOTTOM LINE:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. TREND: No simple pattern! More severe → slightly longer to rehab,
   but Grade D is anomaly (code 888). Generally 20-60 day range.

2. 14.2% IMPORTANCE: AI2RhADa is the #2 most important feature!
   Much more important than you thought (not 7.5%, but 14.2%)

3. IMPORTANCE vs SHAP:
   • Importance = "How useful overall?" (ONE number: 14.2%)
   • SHAP = "How does it affect each patient and each grade?" (THOUSANDS)
   • SHAP shows it impacts Grades B, C, D more than A, E
